I'm a Computer System Engineering student and future FullStack Developer! I love learning, coding and outsmarting myself. 🙋‍♂️

During my university career I was able to develop my programming logic, improve my mathematical thinking and learn Software Engineering. In this period I developed applications with C++, Java and Python, using the SCRUM methodology in some of them.

- 🧠 I’m currently learning PHP-JavaScript and reinforcing my knowledge in HTML-CSS.
- 🖥 I’m currently working at H. Ayuntamiento de Álamo Temapache in the Systems Department.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
